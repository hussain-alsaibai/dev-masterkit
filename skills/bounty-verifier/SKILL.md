# Bounty Verifier

> **Last verified:** 2026-07-01
> Born from the July 1, 2026 Opire scam flood (18/18 issues from 10 throwaway-account fork repos).
> See: [`bounty-scanner`](../bounty-scanner/SKILL.md) for the upstream scanner; this skill is the verification gate.

## When to Use

- Before picking **any** bounty issue, especially from aggregator platforms (Algora, Opire)
- When an issue looks "too good" (high reward + easy task + new repo)
- Whenever the upstream scanner returns N issues and you must pick 0–1 to ship

## The Two-Stage Pattern

### Stage 1 — Hard Filters (fast, boolean)

Reject the issue if **any** of:

| Filter | Value | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| `repo_stars` | `< 50` | Most scams are sub-50 stars; legitimate programs almost never are |
| `repo_age_days` | `< 90` | Throwaway accounts create repo, post fake bounty, vanish |
| `is_fork` | `true` | Scammers fork legitimate projects to inherit credibility |
| `creator_login` | in known-scam list | Cross-reference maintained blacklist |
| `creator_created_at` | `< 30 days ago` | Account age correlates with throwaway behavior |
| `collaborators` | `≤ 1` | Real OSS repos have multiple maintainers |

**Cost:** 2–3 GitHub API calls per issue (`/repos/{o}/{r}` + `/users/{login}`).
**Throughput:** ~100 issues/min on a single token.

### Stage 2 — Behavioral Signals (slower, score-based)

Score 0–10; reject if `< 6`:

| Signal | Weight | What "passes" looks like |
|--------|--------|--------------------------|
| Commit cadence | 0–3 | ≥1 commit / week across the last 90 days, from ≥2 different authors |
| README quality | 0–2 | Non-template: has project description, install, usage, license sections |
| Test/CI present | 0–2 | `tests/` or `__tests__/` directory exists, OR `.github/workflows/` has CI |
| Issue history | 0–2 | ≥10 real issues with non-bot comments in the last 6 months |
| Org affiliation | 0–1 | Repo is under a recognized org (e.g. `apache/`, `cli/`) — bonus, not required |

**Cost:** ~5–8 GitHub API calls per repo (paginated commit list + issue search + workflow list).
**Throughput:** ~20 repos/min.

## Output Shape

For each candidate issue, produce a verdict:

```json
{
  "issue_id": 12345,
  "repo": "owner/name",
  "creator_login": "user",
  "hard_filters": "PASS",
  "behavioral_score": 8,
  "verdict": "PICK",
  "reason": "Active repo, real CI, multiple maintainers, legit-looking issue"
}
```

Or `verdict: "REJECT"` with `reason` citing which stage tripped.

## Anti-Patterns to Watch

These are the actual signals from July 1, 2026:

1. **Fork of a famous project** (Vault, ClickHouse, Traefik, Gitea, Casbin, Apache-Pulsar, VictoriaMetrics, APISIX, spf13-cobra, GORM) — clone the name, post a fake bounty, collect "winners" who never get paid
2. **Throwaway creator account** — `thaohuynh14zc`, `elnahomenick123`, `quachminh11` (names look auto-generated)
3. **No tests, no CI, no real description** — just a `README.md` with the fork source's name
4. **Single collaborator, single commit** — "Initial commit" + the bounty issue
5. **Reward denominated in a token, not USD** — easier to fake, no platform escrow

## Procedure

1. Run `bounty-scanner` (or equivalent) to get a candidate list
2. For each candidate: execute Stage 1 (2–3 API calls)
3. For Stage 1 survivors: execute Stage 2 (5–8 API calls)
4. Pick at most 1 issue with `verdict: PICK`
5. If zero survive, **report the drought** rather than relax the filter

## Quick-Reference (one-liner shell check)

```bash
# Stage 1 fast-reject on Opire issue URL
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo} --jq '.stargazers_count, .created_at, .fork, .size' | \
  awk -F, 'NR==1{if($1<50)exit 1} NR==2{days=(now-mktime(substr($1,1,10)))/86400; if(days<90)exit 2}'
```
